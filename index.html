    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Catherine</p>
    <!--What I did before codeworks-->
    <p>Before codeworks, I was working for a company called Bluewater Vacation Homes - which is a property management
        company for
        vacation homes in La Jolla, Pacific Beach, and Mission beach - as the Quality Assurance
        Coordinator. Bluewater is a smaller company, with only 14 employees, which provided me with an opportunity to
        learn
        quite a lot. I was never pigeon-holed into one department, but I was able to learn from everyone and make a
        position
        for myself. The downside was that it did not pay very well and there were no benefits, despite it being a
        somewhat stressful
        job. After spending a year learning as much as I could, I decided to pursue a career that would challenge me
        and pay off
        at the same time. I've been coding on my own since last April, and I struggled with finding the time and energy
        to pursue
        it every night, despite the fact that I enjoyed it. This is what brought me to Boise Codeworks - I wanted to
        create space in my
        life to dedicate to pursuing this career change, rather than spending my time doing something I truly did not
        enjoy.
